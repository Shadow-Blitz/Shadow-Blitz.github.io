## Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions,
1. Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)
1A: 
In the 1980's began the widespread devlopent of LANs, (Local Area Networks) PC's and workstations.
On Jan 1st, 1983 it was 'flag-day' on this day all hosts were required to simutaneously change from ARPANET host protocol from NCP to TCP/IP. this transition happned quite somothly.
On October 24th, 1995, the FNC (Federal Networking Council) unainmously passed a definition of the term 'Internet'
The term “Internet” refers to the global information system that — (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein.

2.  Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)
2A: 
Domains, are the services that host websites.
Web Servers, are servers that websites and game matches are hosted on. as as server is esentully a very powerful computer, with lots of ram, lots of cpus and a large network thoughput. A server doesnt just need to be one computer, it can be lots and lots of computers. and as soon as you access a web server the computer of that service that is free will serve you.
DNS (Domain Name Systems) is a simple conversion service that converts human readable URLs (IE http://www.google.com.au) to (172.217.167.67) as that is the IPv4 address of Google au. To find out the IP address of a website, simply open Termainal on your computer (MacOS / Linux) or Command Prompt / PowerShell (Windows) and type in ping followed by the url of the site you are accessing (IE ping www.google.com.au) and you will get the IP address of that site.
But don't forget, large busniss websites have multiple IP addresses. so the one you just got may not always work.
as for web browsers. you type in the IP address or the URL and you will get the site you wanted to access.

3.  Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)
3A 
In the beginning of networks, the first ever created network was called the 'Sneekernet' as it was the original form of transmitting electronic information by personally carrying it from one place to another. On a flopy disk or any other removable medium. rather using the much slower telecommunications network.
The first form of LAN was a token ring network, as this network type, only one computer can talk and 1 can receive at the same time. then the computer has to wait for its turn to talk again. but this version of LAN didnt function to well, as when there is a device removed from the ring network, the entire LAN would break.
The next major LAN type we use till today is called Ethernet bassed LAN, as this allows multiple computers to talk and listen at the same time. As well as you can add and remove computers without breaking the network like in token ring networks.
