            <a> Jobs Description
            </a>
            <p> I first started working at the age of 16 whilst living in Darwin, NT. Being already interested in
                computers I started in one of
                the most common jobs for a teenager, fast food to assist in buying my own computer equipment. Over the
                next few years I moved from
                NT and started focusing more on my education. Once I finished Year 12 and starteed my Diploma in IT i
                once again started to work to assist in paying bills and following
                my interests. I started working for a family owned companie of California Dry Cleaners in Brisbane.
                <br>
                <br>
                Part way through 2015 I received my first break into the computer industry as I was chosen out of
                hundreds of applicants to take part in a Hewlett Packard Initiative in Brisbane
                to learn and work as a Test Analyst. During my time working for HP I had the opportunity to work on the
                test versions of the new Medicare systems to ensure that the system was working \
                within parameters and had no issues through the analysis of multiple Test Cases and Bug Analysis. After
                6 months with the HP program the organisers had to let some of the staff go as it
                was designed primarily as a training program and as such I was one of the people that they let go. From
                here I picked up work at the YMCA at Joyner.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the start of this year, through a work awareness company I was able to gain volutary employment at
                one of the local computer shops known as Ed's PC. While I was at Ed's PC I was
                tasked with computer repairs, generating repair reports, correspondace with customers and couriers,
                general customer assistance and diagnostics on computer equipment. This was continued
                up until the week before I started the Coder Academy course.
