            <a> Jobs Description
            </a>
            <p> I first started working at the age of 16 whilst living in Darwin, NT. Being already interested in
                computers I started in one of
                the most common jobs for a teenager, fast food to assist in buying my own computer equipment. Over the
                next few years I moved from
                NT and started focusing more on my education. Once I finished Year 12 and started my Diploma in IT i
                once again started to work to assist in paying bills and following
                my interests. I started working for a family owned company of California Dry Cleaners in Brisbane.
                <br>
                <br>
                Part way through 2015 I received my first break into the computer industry as I was chosen out of
                hundreds of applicants to take part in a Hewlett Packard Initiative in Brisbane
                to learn and work as a Test Analyst. During my time working for HP I had the opportunity to work on the
                test versions of the new Medicare systems to ensure that the system was working \
                within parameters and had no issues through the analysis of multiple Test Cases and Bug Analysis. After
                6 months with the HP program the organisers had to let some of the staff go as it
                was designed primarily as a training program and as such I was one of the people that they let go. From
                here I picked up work at the YMCA at Joyner.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the start of this year, through a work awareness company I was able to gain voluntary employment at
                one of the local computer shops known as Ed's PC. While I was at Ed's PC I was
                tasked with computer repairs, generating repair reports, correspondence with customers and couriers,
                general customer assistance and diagnostics on computer equipment. This was continued
                up until the week before I started the Coder Academy course.

            <a> School History</a>
            <p>
                During the years of 2009 and 2010 I attended the Palmerston Army Cadets every thursday night. We
                also had frequent cadet camps during the school breaks. I also learnt how to be a team leader and be
                fully certified in the operation of the UHF-77 radio set.
                <br> <br>
                I graduated grade 12 in 2012, I particularly enjoyed the IT class during my time at Craigslea State
                High
                School.
                <br> <br>
                Between the years of 2013 and 2015, I did a Cert IV and Diploma in Information Technology and
                Networking. What can I say. it was a fun time, using business grade Cisco equipment was quite fun.
                <br> <br>
                Currently I am studying as a Junior Full Stack Developer through the institution of Coder Academy, Matt
                and Janel that run the course are super chill and helpful lecturers.

                <ul class="hobbies_ul">
                    <li>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (MLP:FiM (Yes I am a Brony))</li>
                    <li>Computer Gaming and VR</li>
                    <li>AI and Cybernetics</li>
                    <li>Car racing and Sim racing on my gaming computer</li>
                    <li>Random topics from the internet</li>
                </ul>
                The reason why I am a Brony, is because the show and the fandom are really nice and carefree.
                <br>
                I also really love tinkering with my electronics and finding out what they can and can not do.
                As with my Simulation ('sim' for short) Racing. I love competing against others and challenging
                myself on racing games.
